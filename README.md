# Thomas Travels Driver Management System 🚖

This is a **Java mini project** developed as part of my learning journey at **FLM Edutech**. The project simulates a backend system for Thomas Travels to manage driver information based on vehicle categories, distances traveled, and other relevant attributes.

## 🛠️ Features Implemented

- Create and manage driver objects using user-defined classes.
- Store driver data using **arrays** (not ArrayList).
- Perform operations such as:
  - Check if a driver is from the “Car” category.
  - Retrieve driver info by ID.
  - Count drivers by category.
  - List drivers based on vehicle category.
  - Identify the driver who has traveled the **maximum distance**.
